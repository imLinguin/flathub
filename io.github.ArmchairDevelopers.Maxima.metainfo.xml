    <p>
      Maxima is in beta. Parts of it may not be fully stable, and we're actively fixing bugs and adding features. Please create an issue if you notice strange behavior.
    </p>

      <li>Locating games</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In-Dev</p>
    <ul>
      <li>MacOS support</li>
      <li>Support for launching Maxima through Epic/Steam</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In-Dev</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Library documentation/examples</li>
      <li>Support for installing DLCs</li>
      <li>Full EA Desktop inteopabillity. Games installed with EA Desktop already appear on Maxima, but to take it a step further we'd like the ability to, for example, start a download on EA Desktop and continue it on Maxima.</li>
      <li>Cleaner/Stabler downloader implementation</li>
      <li>
        Progressive/Selective installs; Some games are able to start without being fully installed, and some games contain language-specific files.
      </li>
      <li>Support for the store (buying games)</li>
      <li>Friend Adding/Removing/Inviting</li>
      <li>Status setting; locked to "online" at the moment</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Unsupported</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Battlefield 3/4 are currently unsupported due to how battlelog does game launching. This is on our radar, but isn't a huge priority at the moment.
        Please file an issue if you find more games that don't work
      </li>
      <li>Old games like Dead Space 2 and BFBC2 are unsupported due to being pre-"Download-In-Place" era games. They have a different manifest format which we need to make a parser for.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Why the name 'Maxima'?</p>
    <p>It's the farthest you can get from the Origin.</p>
